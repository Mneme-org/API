# mneme-api

Written in [python](https://www.python.org/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), it is at the heart of every mneme app, it is what lives in your server and manages your journals, 
essentially all other apps need to "talk" to it to get, create, or update your journals.

It's simple in use in case you want to create your own app that uses it.

For now it supports:
* Create users
* Create journals for users
* Create, delete, and update entries for journals

To do:
* Update and Deletion of users
* Update and Deletion of journals
* Search function for keywords and dates
